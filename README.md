John Conway's Game of Life
==========================

Implementation by Jesse Dufrene

This implementation can run on both the Love2D game engine and on ComputerCraft computers.

To run on a ComputerCraft computer, the `src/main.lua` can be copied to a CC computer and run directly (it can also be
renamed to something like `game-of-life.lua` or `game-of-life`, etc).

Alternatively you can run the following command to get it from pastebin (uses release v1.2):

```
pastebin get Wk3BDsA4 gameoflife
```

There are a few ways to run in Love2D:

1. Open the `game-of-life` subfolder in Love2D (drag and drop to `love.exe`).
2. Open the `game-of-life.love` file by either double clicking it or dragging and dropping to `love.exe`.

The `.love` file can either be retrieved from the Releases page, or it can be made by zipping all files inside the
`game-of-life` subfolder (do not zip the subfolder itself) to a `.zip`, then renaming the extension to be `.love`.
